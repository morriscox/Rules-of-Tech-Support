Rules of Tech Support

*****

Rule 1 - Users lie.
	Rule 1A - It may not be malicious or willful, but Rule 1 is always in effect.
	Rule 1B - Users assume you don't know they are lying.
	Rule 1C - Users continue to lie as a result.
	Rule 1D - When caught in a lie, users get angry.
	Rule 1E - Users lie even when they aren't users.
	Rule 1F - If they are not lying, then they are wrong.
	Rule 1G - Accept that you will eventually have to lie to get the user to do what you need them to do.

Rule 2 - Explain everything as simply as possible.
	Rule 2A - There is no language simple enough to make a user understand anything.
	Rule 2B - Emojis are NEVER an answer.

Rule 3 - User caused problems are caused by tech support.
	Rule 3A - As it's your fault, they don't want to be billed.
	Rule 3B - All issues are user issues. If there are no users, no issues get reported, no tickets get created. Ergo, it must be users who are responsible.

Rule 4 - If it doesn't work, it is your fault.
	Rule 4A - If it does, you had nothing to do with it.

Rule 5 - If you take the time to visit the user's desk, the problem will magically have fixed itself.
	Rule 5A - Or the solution is bound to be really simple.
	Rule 5B - Or the user left the office moments after entering the ticket, and won't be back for days. How long is uncertain as these users never use their calendar.
	Rule 5C - Or when they do, they won't have shared it with you or they entered an all-day event as taking an hour.
	Rule 5D - The problem will be solved by doing something you already asked them to but they said it didn't work.

Rule 6 - All users consider their situation to be more important than others, even if they know you are helping someone else.
	Rule 6A - All users want VIP treatment.
	Rule 6B - But they don't ever want to pay for VIP treatment.

Rule 7 - It doesn't matter how much time the user claims something will take. See *Rule 1*.

Rule 8 - Users never read error messages, if they read anything at all.
	Rule 8A - If a user reads an alert or error message, they don't know what to do even if they can only do one thing.
	Rule 8B - The more advanced degree a user has, the less likely they are to read anything.
	Rule 8C - They will give the wrong error message.
	Rule 8D - If a user receives an error, when asked what it says, the user will reply: "I don't know, just an error. I closed it."
	Rule 8E - "Isn't it YOUR JOB to know that?"
	Rule 8F - Users will not read you the entire error code or message or will read everything else.
	Rule 8G - If the user reads you the error message in its entirety, it will be irrelevant to the issue.

Rule 9 - Expect any and all jargon and technical terms (such as wireless) to be misunderstood.
	Rule 9A - Expect everything to be misinterpreted.
	Rule 9B - All jargon is the same to users.
	Rule 9C - All jargon will be used incorrectly.

Rule 10 - About half of tech support is solving issues that are only partially related to what is supposed to be fixed.

Rule 11 - No system is idiot-proof enough to best all users.
	Rule 11A - If you haven't found a user able to best your system, it's because they haven't found you yet.
	Rule 11B - Nature will take as a challenge any attempt to create an idiot-proof system.

Rule 12 - There is nothing so stupid that no one will do.
	Rule 12A - Stupid questions do exist.
	Rule 12B - There is no such thing as a stupid question, just stupid people. Asking a stupid question identifies a stupid user and therefore the question itself is not stupid.

Rule 13 - Never believe a user who claims that there is nothing that needs to be saved. See *Rule W10* and *Rule W10A*.

Rule 14 - Sometimes you need to trick users in order to get the job done.
	Rule 14A - Sometimes you have to make people, not just users, terrified to get them to do what they are supposed to.

Rule 15 - Users care more about things working than in how you pulled it off.

Rule 16 - A user's appreciation for your work is inversely proportional to how difficult it was.

Rule 17 - If you have an accent, then you will be perceived to be in a foreign country.

Rule 18 - Never trust a user.
	Rule 18A - Everyone is a user. Even you.

Rule 19 - The most intelligent person you know will be defeated by a mere computer.
	Rule 19A - Even if it's you.

Rule 20 - The quickest way to find out who is responsible for something is to do the scream test. Remove that something and see who complains.
	Rule 20A - If nobody screamed instantly, users may wait until it has been long enough that the thing has been thrown away and can't be recovered any more. Then you will learn that said thing was critical for some task that absolutely has to be done right now, just like every X years.

Rule 21 - Never underestimate the power of the end user to complicate things.

Rule 22 - If it looks different, then it's broken.

Rule 23 - Never give a user options.

Rule 24 - When you receive a ticket and call the user immediately they definitely won't be at their desk.
	Rule 24A - If you email them they will already be on vacation.
	Rule 24B - The less time that they're in the office, the more urgent their issue is.

Rule 26 - Always have a small list of phrases to get users to do what you are trying to get them to do.

Rule 30 - It's always the printer|DNS|server|browser|connection. It's never the printer|DNS|server|browser|connection.
	Rule 30A - It's always the printer. Printers are evil.
	Rule 30B - Printers are evil because of users.
	Rule 30C - If a document fails to print, users will keep trying just to make sure it prints.
	Rule 30D - The true importance of the documents they are trying to print will be inversely proportional to the fit they are throwing.
	Rule 30E - Users will mash buttons and go through random menus and do random actions until errors go away or the printer is messed up. See also *Rule W84*.
	Rule 30F - Did you check DNS? Check again.

Rule 31 - All user provided information must be verified.

Rule 32 - If you are a female tech, users will ask to speak to a man.
	Rule 32A - You will be the only one who can actually help the user even though they will not believe a girl really knows anything.
	Rule 32B - You actually know twice as much as the male techs but get only half the respect.
	Rule 32C - Guys will pay more attention to your looks/voice than your mind.
	Rule 32D - You'll get tons of calls from men (especially if you are attractive) who will even disconnect stuff to get you to go to them.

Rule 37 - Focus on getting things working, then on getting them done right.
	Rule 37A - By hook or by crook.
	Rule 37B - When things are working right, leave them alone.
	Rule 37C - If something starts working, even if you KNOW what you just did shouldn't have fixed it, raise your hands in the air unthreatening-like and slowly back out of the room.
	Rule 37D - You only think it's working. The real cause will wait a while and then break everything in a spectacular fashion a few months down the line. Luckily, by then it's usually no longer your problem.
	Rule 37E - It will still be your problem.

Rule 38 - There's always a relevant xkcd.
	Rule 38A - If you can't find a relevant xkcd, it's because you haven't looked hard enough.
	Rule 38B - If there is no relevant xkcd, there is always a relevant Dilbert strip.
	Rule 38C - If there is no relevant xkcd or Dilbert strip, there's a relevant entry in The Seventy Maxims of Maximally Effective Mercenaries. See *Link L1*

Rule 44 - Never make changes before going on vacation.

Rule 45 - The more you specialize, the less you will remember about basic desktop functions.

Rule 47 - Don't help anyone who is not paying you in some way as they won't take your advice seriously.

	Rule 51A - Drivers are the real threat, not hardware.
	Rule 51B - Drivers using hardware [heavy machinery] are also a real threat. Backhoes/diggers have a magnetic attraction to fiber optics and the drivers have an innate ability to find optical fiber. See *Link L2*.
