**Rule 21A** - Even if it's you.

##Rule 22 - The quickest way to find out who is responsible for something is to do the scream test. Remove that something and see who complains.

**Rule 22A** - If nobody screamed instantly, users may wait until it has been long enough that the thing has been thrown away and can't be recovered any more. Then you will learn that said thing was critical for some task that absolutely has to be done right now, just like every X years.

**Rule T10B** - Printers are evil because of users.

##Rule T11 - Just because it worked yesterday does not mean that it will today.

**Rule T11A** - Just because it didn't work yesterday does not mean that it won't today.

**Rule T21C** - If none of these apply, the solution will be something random that will make no sense whatsoever to you or the technician.

##Rule T22 - Vendors will tell you that you need to upgrade to the newest version in order to fix things. If you are on the latest version, they will tell you to wait till the next version.

**Rule T22A** - If the problem remains reproducible on the latest version, they may tell you to downgrade. Even if you just upgraded per **Rule** T22.

**Rule T22B** - It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature.

##Rule T31 - Drivers will drive you bonkers. They are an accomplice to *Rule* T10A.

**Rule T31A** - Drivers are the real threat, not hardware.

**Rule T31B** - Drivers using hardware [heavy machinery] are also a real threat. Backhoes/diggers have a magnetic attraction to fiber optics and the drivers have an innate ability to find optical fiber. See **Link** L4.

##Rule T39 - Use your inner laziness to do the most elegant solution possible.

##Rule T41 - Every company has a Production environment. If you're lucky, they have a separate Test environment.

##Rule T42 - You might want to consider starting the day with coffee or tea and ending with whiskey or scotch or bourbon or beer...

##Rule T43 - You might find people who support you. Reciprocate.

##Rule T44 - When a user activates the Swedish Fish rule, they get preferential treatment.

##Rule T45 - Make sure your fellow techs agree on what Rules to use.

##Rule T46 - Like the military says, never volunteer.

##Rule T47 - Some bugs are Heisenbugs; they can only occur if they are not being observed. Users do not count as observers.

##Rule T48 - Something will be needed right after you get rid of it.

**Rule T48A** - Once you replace it, you will no longer need it.

##Rule T48B** - You will buy something and then find out that what you currently have already has what you needed.

##Rule M5 - Management will expect you to be up to speed on their under-the table projects, with decisions based only on what the salesman says, without consulting IT.

##Rule M6 - Your boss will not have a tech background.

##Rule M7 - Management will present impossible tasks to be done.

#**Phrases**

##Rule P1 - Have you tried turning it off and on again?

##Rule P2 - Is it plugged in?

*****
*****

#**Mantras**

##OM1 - Mentat Mantra (Dune modified)  
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.  
It is by the beans of Java the thoughts acquire speed.  
The hands acquire shaking.  
The shaking becomes a warning.  
It is by caffeine alone I set my mind in motion.
*****

##OM2 - We the Willing mantra

We the willing, led by the unknowing  
Did the impossible for the ungrateful  
We have done so much for so long with so little  
That we can now do anything with nothing.

#**Feedback**

*****
*****

##Feedback F1 - Should Rule numbers be in the format of <number> (e.g., Rule 8) and <letter><number> (e.g., Rule T32)? That is the current system. Or in <xxx> format (e.g., Rule 201)? Rule 1 would stay Rule 1 in either case, though it would also be Rule 100 with the latter.

##Feedback F2 - Should this list be split into individual posts or stay as one?

##Feedback F3 - Only contributions from here and that I come up with independently of any other Reddit are here, per this Reddit's copyright policy.

##Feedback F4 - I will post on the first of each month, conditions permitting, with at least one revised version within a week to address feedback. The version format will be YYYY-MM-DD, including for changelogs. No changelogs on GitHub.

##Feedback F5 - A set of tech support RPG cards (or a rulebook) would be awesome. Anyone willing to join forces?

##Feedback F6 - Moving changelogs to GitHub for easier tracking of changes. Monthly snapshots will be posted on the first, conditions permitting.

##Feedback F7 - Suggestions for new sections?
