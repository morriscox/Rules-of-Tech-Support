# Dealing with Management
*****
#### Rule M1 - Management might find these rules. Plead ignorance.

#### Rule M2 - Never believe anything management tells you.

**Rule M2A** - Especially if a merger or bad news is involved.

#### Rule M3 - Management will order stuff they have no clue about.

**Rule M3A** - Management will expect the thing they bought to work perfectly out of the box.

**Rule M3B** - You will be blamed when it doesn't work.

#### Rule M4 - Management will be puzzled as to why you have no clue about the thing they have no clue about...

#### Rule M5 - Management will expect you to be up to speed on their under the table projects, with decisions based only on what the salesman says, without consulting IT.

#### Rule M6 - Your boss will not have a tech background or a degree in your field.

#### Rule M7 - Management will present impossible tasks to be done.

**Rule M7A** - Management will then become outraged that said tasks were not completed.

#### Rule M8 - Management will blame you when things do not work.

#### Rule M9 - Management will blame you if anything that was completed does not meet their expectations (they won't), no matter how difficult they were.

#### Rule M10 - If a project makes sense, something is wrong.

#### Rule M11 - If it's free or very cheap, management will think that it cannot be as good as the commercial stuff.

#### Rule M12 - Not all management is bad. Seriously.

#### Rule M13 - Do not, in any circumstances, send private *anything* via email. Especially if you're the CEO.

#### Rule M14 - You will never get interviewed by anyone who will actually understand your answers.

#### Rule M15 - Management will give you a budget of zero dollars and expect you to work miracles.

#### Rule M16 - Management never wants to pay to upgrade anything.

**Rule M16A** - Unless it's for management.

#### Rule M17 - Managers might fire you for going outside the scope of your job.

**Rule M17A** - Managers will tell you to go outside the scope of your job, even if you don't report to them.

**Rule M17B** - Users will insist on you going outside the scope of your job and threaten to have you fired if you don't.

#### Rule M18 - Better tools and solutions exist. You just either don't know about them or you can't afford them. Even if you can, management won't let you get them.

#### Rule M19 - Management only cares about productivity that is reported.

**Rule M19A** - Find out what figure they think is the most important and focus your efforts on that.

#### Rule M20 - Management will have you do their job for them.

#### Rule M21 - Management will take away your tools and expect you to use the same equipment as every one else and yet expect you to do your job anyway.

#### Rule M22 - Being a tech in management doesn't make you exempt from the Rules, even *Rule M1* (when it comes to dealing with upper management).
